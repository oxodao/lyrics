# Karaoke

Source song files for karaoke I built for my own usage.

Those are KBP files for the Karaoke Builder Studio software.

No need to pay as it's only for sync'ing the lyrics, just use [kbp2ass](https://github.com/Aeden-B/kbp2ass) + [ffmpeg](https://partyhall.github.io/docs/partynexus/karaoke/making-karaoke-song) to have a proper video afterward.

## Old songs

I made old song way back, IDK which youtube video matches the KBP, good luck

## LEGALS

Be sure to buy the song you use of course ;)
